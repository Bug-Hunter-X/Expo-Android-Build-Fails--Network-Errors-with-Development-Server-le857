# Expo Android Build Failure: Network Connectivity Issues

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while building an Expo project for Android. The project builds successfully on iOS, but fails on Android due to what seems to be a network connectivity problem between the Expo development server and the Android emulator/device.  The error messages are inconsistent but often relate to network requests failing or the packager not starting correctly.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Attempt to start the project using `expo start`.  The project will build and run correctly on iOS.  However, when attempting to run it on an Android device or emulator, it will likely encounter the described errors.

## Potential Causes

* Issues with network configuration or firewalls.
* Problems with the Expo development server.
* Incompatibilities with the Android emulator/device or its SDKs.

## Solution

The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`. This might involve resetting the packager, clearing the cache, checking network settings, making sure the correct SDKs are installed and properly configured, and potentially restarting the devices and development machine.
