While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the interaction between Expo's development server and the Android emulator or device.  The specific error message varied, sometimes mentioning issues with network connectivity,  'Network request failed', or problems with the packager not starting correctly.  The project built successfully when running on iOS. This problem only surfaced on Android. I tried several different emulators and physical Android devices, all with the same result.  I've checked my network settings and there are no firewalls or network restrictions blocking the connection. The Android device/emulator is properly configured and connected to the same network as my development machine.  I also ensured that the correct SDKs and build tools are installed, and that the Android environment is correctly set up and configured according to Expo's documentation.
