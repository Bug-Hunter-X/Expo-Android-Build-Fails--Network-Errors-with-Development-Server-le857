The solution involved a combination of steps. First, I completely closed the Expo development server and then cleared the cache using the command `expo prebuild --clean`. I then restarted both the development server and the Android emulator.  In some cases, you might also need to make sure that port forwarding is properly configured on your Android virtual device (especially if using a virtual device) and that the necessary environment variables are correctly set and that you check your Android device's firewall.  While the underlying cause was unclear, this set of steps resolved the problem reliably across different emulators and devices.
